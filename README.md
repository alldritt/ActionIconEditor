# ActionIconEditor

This project investigates how to mimic the Shortcut Icon/Color editing view found in iOS 13's Shortcuts app from Apple.

Here's where I'm at so far.  I still have to improve the organization of the glyphs offered and then go back and refactor the code to make it simpler to understand.
